Error: unknown option `mistyped`

Options are:
- match_constructor_through_ref: true | false
    whether `[p]` can match on `&[T]`; the heart of match ergonomics.
- eat_inherited_ref_alone: true | false
    whether `&p`/`&mut p` is allowed on an inherited reference if the underlying type isn't also a reference type
- inherited_ref_on_ref: EatOuter | EatInner | EatBoth
    how to handle a reference pattern on a double reference when the outer one is inherited
- fallback_to_outer: true | false
    whether to try again in `EatOuter` mode when a `EatBoth` or `EatInner` case has a mutability mismatch
- allow_ref_pat_on_ref_mut: true | false
    whether to allow `&p: &mut T`
- simplify_deref_mut: true | false
    whether to simplify `*&mut expr`, which removes some borrow errors
- downgrade_mut_inside_shared: true | false
    RFC3627 rule 3: downgrade `&mut` inherited references to `&` inside a shared deref
- dont_eat_mut_inside_shared: true | false
    in `EatInner` or `EatBoth`, disallow eating an inner `&mut T` with `&mut p` from under a `&`
- ref_binding_on_inherited: ResetBindingMode | AllocTemporary | Error
    how to handle a `ref x` binding on an inherited reference
- mut_binding_on_inherited: ResetBindingMode | Keep | Error
    how to handle a `mut x` binding on an inherited reference
- predicate_style: Expression | Sequent | BindingMode | Stateless
    the style of the typing predicate; not all rulesets can be expressed in all styles, only `Expression` is compatible with all rulesets

There also exist some predefined option-bundles. Activate one with `set <bundle>`
- default: a reasonable proposal; like `stateless` but forbids `ref` bindings that create temporaries
- stateless: a proposal that tracks no hidden state; purely type-based
- stable_rust: emulates the behavior of current stable rust
- ergo2024: the accepted RFC3627 behavior
- rfc3627_2021: the accepted RFC3627 behavior under edition 2021
- ergo2024_breaking_only: the breaking changes for edition 2024 planned in RFC3627
- structural: purely structural matching, with no match ergonomics
- waffle: a proposal by @WaffleLapkin (excluding the proposed rule3 extension)
